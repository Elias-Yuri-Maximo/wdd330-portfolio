    <h1>HTML5 APIs</h1>
    <p>Latest version of Hypertext markup language <br>
    brought together a number of related technologies</p>

    <h2>HTML 5</h2>
    <p>Html 5.1 is the current standard, html 5.3 is currently in development 
       Allows different specification to be separated.  
    </p>

    <h2>data- Attribute</h2>
    <p>Way of embedding data in a page using custom attributes</p>
    <p>Intended to be used by external service</p>
    <p>Examples of data-</p>
    <p>data-powers = 'flight superSpeed' <br>
        data-rating = '5' <br>
        data-dropdown <br>
        data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
        data-max-length = '32'</p>
    <p>Can be used to identify particular elements</p>
    <p>Data dropdown could be used as a dropdown lostfor instance</p>

    <p>Example of embeded attribute data- (see html)/p>
    <div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'>
        Superman
    </div>
    <p>const superman = document.getElementById('hero');<br>
        const powers = superman.dataset.powers;<br>
        'flight superSpeed'</p>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <p>Contains several APIs that give access to devices</p>
    <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
    <p>Web storage provides  a key-value store on client's computer</p>
    <p>This is different from cookies. 
        <br>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.
        <br>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).
        <br>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).
        <br>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.
    </p>

    <p>Things work basically like localstorage</p>
