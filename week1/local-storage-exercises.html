        <h1>Mobile First</h1>
        <p>Nowadays we have a wide range of devices.
        and most people don't have a desktop computer
        most people will use my websites thorugh
        a mobile phone.

        <br>
        <br>People usually don't know what they 
        want until I show it to them. 
        Provide what the client wants as
        fast as possible.

        <br>
        <br>Reachability matters. Make sure that 
        things are in reach. The fastest things load the 
        bigger the retention of users. 

        <br>
        <br>Network affects the speed. Most people 
        in the world have access only to 3g. 
        </p>
       
        <h2>Things to do to reduce speed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce image usage</li>
            <li>SVG and webfonts are lower bandwith</li>
            <li>Optimize Js and CSS files (reduce white space)</li>
            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unecessary data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We need to be empathetic to user's needs. 
            Primary controls. Put them as close as possible to the user. 
            (Bottom of the screen). Reachability creates a sense of speed.
            Don't use the hamburger menu. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Forms: focus on the important things first. Make the user 
            think less. Forms ask too much from information from the
            user. Reduce cognitive load. Float labels. Present the numbers
            with a number pad.
            <br>
            Make things as easy as possible for the users.
        </p>

            <a href="tel:19988008720">19988008720</a> -> This code will
            automatically call when clicked.

            It is the end user who shapes the market. Research before 
            advertising. Make advertising small and simple. make a drop down
            add, with a small strip being shown, that reveals more content
            when clicked.
