        <h1>Week 5 notes</h1>
        <p>Errors and Bugs will always be present,<br>
         we as programmers must deal with them and work around them <br>
        <ul>
            <li>system ERROR</li>
            <li>Programmer error</li>
            <li>User error</li>
        </ul>
        Always minimalize logic and syntax Errors <br>
        Work around system error
        </p>
        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>Exceptions hae stack traces that pint to the error<br></p>
        <h2>Warnings</h2>
        <p>Warnings are errors that cause the program to crash, but they can be problematic <br>
        Make sure the program fails loudly <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
        <p>
            This is the hardcore mode of JS <br>
            It causes the poor style to become errors, it delivers a better quality of code <br>
            'use strict'; - Add this to the beginning of a js file and it enters strict mode <br>
            It can also be added to specific functions <br>
            Recommended way of invocking the Strict Mode<br>
            (function() {
            <br>    'use strict';
            
            <br>    // All your code would go inside this function
            
            <br>}());
            <br><br>
            Linting tools such as <strong>JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint</strong> can be used to also enforce styling
        </p>
            <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
            <p>Feature detection is something that helps to check <br>
            And keep up if browsers support a feature <br>
            <br> ONE WAY TO DO IT : 
            <br>
            if (window.holoDeck) {    virtualReality.activate();}
            <br> This would return undefined
               
        </p>

        <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
        <p>
            logs and alerts can be used
            <br>
            The braweser debug tool can also be used
            <br>
            debugger keywork will create a breakpoint
            <br>

        </p>
        <h2>Error Objects</h2>
        <p>
            This creates an error object: const error = new Error();]
            <br>
            Throw will help the program to crash loudly
            <br>
            The best practice is to throw error objects
            <br>throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');

        </p>
        <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>Try and Catch Blocks  are used basically just like python<br>
            A finally block can be also added in order to execute something <br>
            REGARDLESS OF THE EXCEPTION <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>
            A test can be a function that tests what we wrote
        </p>
        <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Write Tests</li>
            <li>Write Code to pass the Tests</li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test the refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
        </ol>
        This is BEST practice but not always used
        
            <h3>Jest</h3>
        <p>
            npm install -g jest <br>

            **LOOK DEEPER INTO JEST LATER**
