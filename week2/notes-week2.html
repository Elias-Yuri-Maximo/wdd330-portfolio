        <h2>Notes 1 - programming Basics</h2>
        <p>No need to use semicolon, but it is a best practice to use them
            <br>
        Block: statements inside curly braces
            <br>
        Reserved words: abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
            <br>
        Data Types: String, Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)
        Number,
        Boolean,
        Undefined,
        Null
            <br>
        Everything else is considered an object.
        </p>
        Const: used when the value will not be reassigned. (using const on an object such as an array, will alow you to mutate(change the object))<br>
        let: used when the value can be reassigned
        <br>(Try to use const as much as possible in order to make the program predictable)
        <br>
        const and let are block scoped (they values only exist inside the blocks they are in )
        <br>
        Train to keep Global Variables to a minimum
        <br>
