document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
//This block of code will add an evento listener to Body 
//where doSomething is a function to be defined.

//IT IS BETTER TO SET THE EVENTS ON THE JAVASCRIPT

// Current Standard are event listeners

//An anonymous arrow function could be added in order to 
//do the thing it's supposed to do
addEventListener('click', () => alert('You Clicked!'));
